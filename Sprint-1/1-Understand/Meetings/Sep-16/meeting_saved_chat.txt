11:23:02	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : Dev, Molli, and/or Amy, et al — I do have a few slides to share — do I have share screen permissions, or do I need to be a co-host? Thanks!
11:24:03	 From Dev : Hi Prof. Elizabeth, you do have screen share permissions.
11:24:28	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : Many thanks, Dev!
11:27:39	 From Melanie A. Killen : Might want  8-10 customers to get responses from kids at different ages (a few at each of 4, 5, 6, and 7 years of age), if feasible.
11:34:44	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : We will try to recruit them — our youngest @KidsTeam are ~7-8, but we’ve co-designed with our older youth to “think of your younger siblings/cousins/etc” when they design. It is a nice proxy when we can’t have the exact age range. That said, we’ve also worked with CYC (UMD’s CYC)…
11:35:11	 From Melanie A. Killen : Yes, sounds great.
11:47:46	 From Bill Kules : HCIM team - you should be taking notes on the board as we go...
11:48:25	 From Bill Kules : Capture key points, insights, questions, etc….
11:50:58	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : Are all the slides going to be available to the team? (Not just the design/HCIM students?) Thanks!
11:57:59	 From Bill Kules : Yes - Molli will gather and share them
11:58:25	 From Bill Kules : Team - what questions do you have for Melanie?
12:05:21	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : Yes - thanks very much, Melanie — very informative about the foundational skills that the playful design aims to support
12:23:38	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : The idea of leveling up to different/larger challenges is a good but longstanding design mechanic (i.e., since Nintendo DS), though today’s tech allows for more complexity.
13:00:53	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : It’s great to see so many students I’ve worked with before — as well as new faces on this team! So excited to work with you all on this very very very valuable project for children. ^_^ Thank you for a great meeting…!
13:01:37	 From Elizabeth Marie Bonsignore : Yes, Molli — will send it to the thread after our meeting.
13:03:18	 From Ekta Shokeen : Thankyou everyone it was nice hearing you all. I need to be in another meeting. Bye everyone
13:22:40	 From Bryce McCoy Hammond : do we want to make a when to meet/doodle so we can get our availability for recurring team meetings?
13:22:55	 From Dev : That seems like a good idea
13:23:09	 From Bryce McCoy Hammond : cc’ed
